Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the TalentCell Rechargeable 3000mAh DC 12V/5V USB Battery Pack (Model: YB1203000-USB) for CAD modeling:

General Shape and Dimensions:
Form Factor: The battery has a rectangular box-like shape with smooth edges and a flat base. Its approximate dimensions are 105mm x 65mm x 25mm.
Material: The casing is made of durable black plastic with a matte finish.
Design Features: There is a slightly curved contour pattern on the top surface for aesthetics.
Features:
LED Indicators:

On the top face, there are 5 small LED lights positioned in a straight line, likely green when powered on. These lights indicate the battery's charge status.
Ports and Switch:

On one of the shorter sides (front face), there are three main components:
A cylindrical DC input port (to the left).
A rectangular USB-A port in the middle.
A small rocker switch (labeled "I" for on and "O" for off) on the right.
Flat Surfaces:

The bottom is entirely flat to rest on surfaces without rocking or tilting.
The sides and edges are simple, smooth, and unadorned.
Thickness:

The thickness is consistent at around 25mm, with no bulges or additional projections beyond the ports and switch.
Notes for CAD:
Ports: Model the USB and DC ports with approximate standard dimensions:
USB-A: 14.5mm x 6mm.
DC Port: Circular with a diameter of approximately 5.5mm.
LED Lights: Place them in a straight line on the top surface, evenly spaced.
Switch: Position the rocker switch flush with the surface, on the right of the front face.
This description should be sufficient to recreate an accurate 3D model of the battery in CAD software.
